# Crack the Code! 🔐

A simple number-guessing logic game built with vanilla JavaScript. Inspired by classic code-breaking puzzles like Mastermind.

## 🎮 How to Play
- A 2 to 4-digit secret number is randomly generated.
- You have limited attempts to guess it.
- After each guess, you'll get hints to help narrow down the code.

## 🛠️ Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## 📦 Features
- Random code generation
- Attempt-based feedback
- Simple and responsive design

## ✨ Why I Built This
To explore JavaScript logic building through a fun, interactive game. It was a great opportunity to strengthen DOM manipulation and condition-based feedback design.

I recently discovered (thanks to a sassy friend of mine — or not 😏) that the guest number on this site isn't actually hidden and can still be checked through browser tools or inspecting the code.. might learn to solve this issue soon, who knows? 😅
